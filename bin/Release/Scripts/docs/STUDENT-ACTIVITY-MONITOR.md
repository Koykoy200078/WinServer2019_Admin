## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Monitoring

- Check at start of each class
- Random checks during class
- End-of-day summary

### 2. Response to Alerts

🔴 **High Priority** (During Exams):

- Immediately check suspicious PCs
- Remote lock if needed
- Document violations

🟡 **Medium Priority** (During Class):

- Note the student
- Verbal warning
- Continue monitoring

🟢 **Low Priority** (Free Time):

- Informational only
- Track trends

### 3. Privacy Considerations

- Inform students monitoring is active
- Use for educational purposes only
- Respect privacy during breaks

### 4. Performance Tips

- Monitor specific range during class (not all 35)
- Use export for historical records
- Run full scans during breaks

## Troubleshooting

### "PC offline" errors

- Check if PC is powered on
- Verify network connection
- Ensure WinRM is enabled

### "Access Denied"

- Verify admin credentials
- Check domain membership
- Ensure proper permissions

### No suspicious apps detected when you see them

- App names may differ from detection list
- Use "View all processes" option
- Check window titles

### Slow scanning

- Normal for 35 PCs (1-3 minutes)
- Monitor smaller ranges for speed
- Close other network-intensive tasks
